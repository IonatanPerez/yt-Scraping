# yt-Scraping
Project to bulk download all videos from used.

There are many repositories like this one on GitHub, but I didn't find any that was actually working on actual youtube site. I assume that they were working on older versions of the site, so I decided to make my own just to get the list of videos and then download them using another tool like jdownloader.
